# uncrustify
Uncrustify settings I use with C, C++ and Objective C

After fighting to understand a variety of code samples and behing hindered by the "because I like it that way"
variations, I decided to dedicate a significant amount of time to first fine a good tool (BBUncrustify) and then
understand the sometimes cryptic Uncrustify variable names used to format and reformat code.

The result is the uncrustify file being maintained here...  that can be used in Xcode with the 
BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode (Merci beaucoup Beno√Æt Bourdon!) http://git.io/jDNFTw
